S3://
	yodleeproducts/

The S3 bucket, "yodleeproducts", is the home for every data product we provide to our customers via S3.
For simplicity's sake, all panels are grouped under the "panels" directory:

S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		panels/

If in the future, we offered another type of data product via S3, that directory would go here as well:

S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		panels/
		another_yodlee_product/
