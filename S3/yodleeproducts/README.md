The S3 bucket, **yodleeproducts**, is the home for every data product we provide to our customers via S3.
For simplicity's sake, all panels are grouped under the **panels** directory:

<pre>
S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		panels/
</pre>

If in the future, we offered **another_group_of_products** via S3, that directory would be placed at the same level as the **panels** directory:

<pre>
S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		another_group_of_products/
		panels/
</pre>
