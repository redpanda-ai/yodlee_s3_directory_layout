The S3 bucket, **yodleeproducts**, is the home for every data product we provide to our customers via S3.
For simplicity's sake, all panels are grouped under the **panels** directory:

<pre>
S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		panels/
</pre>

If in the future, we offered another type of data product via S3, that directory would go here as well:

<pre>
S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		panels/
		another_yodlee_product/
</pre>
