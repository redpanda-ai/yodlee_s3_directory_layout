panels
==============

<pre>
S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		panels/
</pre>

For simplicity's sake, all panels are grouped under the **panels** directory.  Here we can see there are 5 different panel offerings for our customers:

<pre>
S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		panels/
			3m/
			6m/
			australia/
			canada/
			mastercard/
</pre>

If in the future, we offered **a_new_panel** via S3, that directory would be placed within the **panels** directory:

<pre>
S3://
	yodleeproducts/
		panels/
			3m/
			6m/
			a_new_panel/
			australia/
			canada/
			mastercard/
</pre>
